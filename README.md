# setup_webpack_from_scratch_angular


I build the following project when I was learning how to setup webpack for Angular from scratch.

It's simple but it helped me to learn how webpack works for Angular and AngularJs


### Build steps :

- clone the repository
- run `npm install` to install the required dependencies
- run `npm run-script build` to build the project with webpack
- And `npm start ` to start the project.
